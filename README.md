# Process
If you build it they will come. But if you design it, will they build it?

I have been working on ideas for a while but had little idea for a process. I'm attracted to Domain Driven Design and think that there are aspects of that which can work here, especially with establishing a clear shared vocabulary amongst players and developers, but recently I encountered this process called c4 by Pieter Hinjents.

I really like this and will try to follow it for the technical parts of the project. That means I need to find at least one more collaborator soon and tame the natural complexity of even a minimal game in this space.

One variation from c4 is that I'll have one repo specifically for brainstorming and storing crazy ideas, because that's just the way I am. 

In fact, there is a significant variation on his thoughts on 'complexity oriented design' that I'd like to see tried in an open source space, that is "If you design it, will they build it?" While the open source community has had a lot of success building programming libraries by staying small and focused in areas where the programmers understand the use cases as they are also the users. It hasn't done very well in userspace. Generally I think that's because user level design is valuable.

One question I've always wanted to know the answer to is. If there was a good open source design, complete with tests, would programmers naturally fill in the implementations. In particular I'd like governments to do their development that way. Since it is their responsability to manage the goals and scope, maybe what government development should really do is just focus on specing things accurately and then giving small contracts to open source developers. If the tests pass, they get paid.

Immediate tasks ahead.
  1. Find a second person
  2. List the essential problems
  3. Design a minimal solution
