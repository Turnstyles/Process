# Process
Proof of Concept plus C4

I have been working on ideas for a while but had little idea for a process. I'm attraced to Domain Driven Design and think that there are aspects of that which can work here, especially with establishing a clear shared vocabulary amongs players and developers, but recently I encountered this process called c4 by Pieter Hinjents.

I really like this and will try to follow it. That means I need to find at least one more collaborator soon.

Immediate tasks ahead.
  1. Find a second person
  2. List the essential problems
  3. Continue a minimal solution
