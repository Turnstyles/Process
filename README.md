# Process
It's been said that if you build it, they will come. But if you design it, will they build it?

I'm attracted to Domain Driven Design for the high level design, especially in establishing a clear shared vocabulary amongst players, designers and developers, but recently I encountered a process called c4 by Pieter Hinjents which I'd like to use for the technical aspects of the project ([c4](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22/C4/)). 

[Here is a more narrative intro to it - (Start with the Preliminaries section)](https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/social-architecture/content/chapter4.html)

That means I need to find at least one more collaborator soon and tame the natural complexity of even a minimal game in this space. In fact, there is a significant variation on his thoughts on 'complexity oriented design' that I'd like to see tried in an open source space, that is "If you design it, will they build it?" 

While the open source community has had a lot of success building programming libraries where the developers are also the users. One question I've always wanted to know the answer to is. If there was a good open source design, complete with tests, would programmers naturally fill in the implementations? In particular I'd like governments to try and do their development that way. Since it is their responsability to manage the goals and scope, maybe what government development should really do is just focus on specing things accurately and then giving small contracts to open source developers. If the tests pass, they get paid.

While this is just a personal project in a space where many programmers have a traditional interest, it might be a good test to see if this is possible.

Immediate tasks ahead.
  1. Find a second person
  2. List the essential problems
  3. Design a minimal proof of concept
  4. Create or link to a basic tutorial for artists and game designers on using git with the c4 process.
