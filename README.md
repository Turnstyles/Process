# Process
Proof of Concept plus C4

I have been working on ideas for a while but had little idea for a process. I'm attraced to Domain Driven Design and think that there are aspects of that which can work here, especially with establishing a clear shared vocabulary amongs players and developers, but recently I encountered this process called c4 by Pieter Hinjents.

I really like this and will try to follow it. That means I need to find at least one more collaborator soon.

One variation from c4 is that I'll have one repo specifically for brainstorming and storing crazy ideas, because that's just the way I am.

Immediate tasks ahead.
  1. Find a second person
  2. List the essential problems
  3. Continue a minimal solution
